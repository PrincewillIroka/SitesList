# SitesList
Someone sent this Wireframe to me, and I converted it to this app within a few hours using React Native. The app fetches data from this endpoint https://s3.amazonaws.com/decom_uploads/external/sites.json. The data is parsed and displayed in a list view. If the user taps on one of the sites,the application navigates to a detail view. The App also has "Infinite Scroll" feature implemented by Mobile Apps such as Facebook, Instagram e.t.c
